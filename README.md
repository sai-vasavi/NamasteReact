## What is Emmet?
Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.Emmet uses a shorthand syntax to generate HTML and CSS code, which expands to a full code by the code editor or the plugin. It is a toolkit that helps developers to write code in a code editor like vs code, sublime Text, etc.
